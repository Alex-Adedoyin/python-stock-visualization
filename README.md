# ðŸ“ˆ Normalized Stock Price Analysis (2015â€“2025)

This project analyzes the historical price movements of a diversified portfolio of 10 leading U.S. stocks alongside the S&P 500 Index over a 10-year period (2015â€“2025). The prices are normalized (i.e., indexed to 1) to facilitate a fair comparison of growth trajectories, regardless of nominal stock price.
